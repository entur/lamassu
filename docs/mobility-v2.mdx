# Mobility v2-beta

Aggregation API for micro-mobility services. This API is currently in beta, and breaking changes may occur without notice.

## GBFS

Currently we offer data from a number of citybike and scooter operators in several Norwegian cities..
All of our data is served in [version 2.1 of the General Bikeshare Feed Specification (GBFS)](https://github.com/NABSA/gbfs/blob/v2.1-RC2/gbfs.md) format which is a standardized data feed for micro-mobility systems.

### List the GBFS endpoint for all operators

All currently implemented operators and their respective gbfs endpoints will be listed under the root endpoint.

#### HTTP Request

`GET https://api.entur.io/mobility/v2/gbfs`

#### Example response

```
{
    "operators": [
        {
            "name": "oslobysykkel",
            "url": "https://api.entur.io/mobility/v2/gbfs/oslobysykkel/gbfs"
        },
        {
            "name": "boltoslo",
            "url": "https://api.entur.io/mobility/v2/gbfs/boltoslo/gbfs"
        }
    ]
}

```

### GBFS information for an operator

Get the different GBFS endpoints for a specific operator.

#### HTTP Request

`GET https://api.entur.io/mobility/v2/gbfs/{operator}/gbfs`

Where `{operator}` is one of the above mentioned operators, for instance `oslobysykkel`.
