# Mobility v2

Aggregation API for micro-mobility services.

## GBFS

Currently we offer data from a number of citybike and scooter operators in several Norwegian cities.

All of our data is served in [version 2.2 of the General Bikeshare Feed Specification (GBFS)](https://github.com/NABSA/gbfs/blob/v2.2/gbfs.md) format which is a standardized data feed for micro-mobility systems.

### List the GBFS endpoint for all operators

All currently implemented operators and their respective gbfs endpoints will be listed under the root endpoint.

#### HTTP Request

`GET https://api.entur.io/mobility/v2/gbfs`

#### Example response

```
{
    "operators": [
        {
            "name": "oslobysykkel",
            "url": "https://api.entur.io/mobility/v2/gbfs/oslobysykkel/gbfs"
        },
        {
            "name": "boltoslo",
            "url": "https://api.entur.io/mobility/v2/gbfs/boltoslo/gbfs"
        }
    ]
}

```

### GBFS information for an operator

Get the different GBFS endpoints for a specific operator.

#### HTTP Request

`GET https://api.entur.io/mobility/v2/gbfs/{operator}/gbfs`

Where `{operator}` is one of the above mentioned operators, for instance `oslobysykkel`.

#### Example response

                }
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

## GraphQL

We also offer a client-centric GraphQL API as a way to aggregate data across all providers. It currently offers two
entrypoints to finding entities near a location: vehicles and stations.

The GraphQL endpoint's URL is https://api.entur.io/mobility/v2/graphql

An interactive IDE for exploring this API is available at https://api.entur.io/graphql-explorer/mobility
